{"name":"PrimeFaces Extensions","body":"## Description\r\n**PrimeFaces Extensions project** is a community driven open source project which has an aim to be a lightweight and fast JSF 2 component library in additional to [PrimeFaces](http://www.primefaces.org) - a rapidly evolving component set and more. We are big fans of PrimeFaces. This project is an extended component set with useful components missing in other JSF 2 libraries or with improved components which already exist somewhere but don't work there smoothly. It only uses standards and is highly compatible with existing JSF 2 frameworks. We use one of the best JavaScript framework [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) behind the scenes with its amazing widgets, plugins, themes and Ajax interactions. We avoid on purpose other JS / UI frameworks in order to have a high compatibility between components.\r\n\r\nPrimeFaces Extensions is not only a component set, converters and client behaviors. It also consist of useful Maven plugins and various Add-ons simplifying Web and especially JSF development.  \r\n\r\nPrimeFaces Extensions is an open source project licensed under Apache License V2. You can use it completely free in open source or commercial projects following the terms of the license.\r\n\r\n## Main Project Resources\r\nShowcase is deployed on Jetty 8 for both current JSF implementations: Mojarra and MyFaces.\r\n * [Mojarra based showcase](http://fractalsoft.net/primeext-showcase-mojarra/)\r\n * [MyFaces based showcase](http://fractalsoft.net/primeext-showcase-myfaces/)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nWe use Jenkins as continuous integration tool. It builds projects daily in the midnight. You can download the last runnable showcase as well as all other JAR files from the [CloudBees platform](https://pf-extensions.ci.cloudbees.com/). The WAR file is deployable on every Servlet 2.5 compatible servlet container.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nGeneral questions can be discussed in the [PrimeFaces forum](http://forum.primefaces.org/viewforum.php?f=3). We also have a [PrimeFaces Extensions sub-forum](http://forum.primefaces.org/viewforum.php?f=14). Using of the sub-forum is preferred for all questions related to this project.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n[Getting Started with PrimeFaces Extensions](https://github.com/primefaces-extensions/primefaces-extensions.github.com/wiki/Getting-Started) describes how to setup and work with the component library. This section contains links to the download repository and dependent third-party projects. Extensive documentation is integrated into the showcase. \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nRoadmap. We intend to release PrimeFaces Extensions project approximately in the same manner as described in [PrimeFaces Roadmap](http://code.google.com/p/primefaces/wiki/Roadmap). Expected release dates of final releases are coupled with [PrimeFaces](http://www.primefaces.org/). The current released version is **0.6.2**.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n[Release notes](https://github.com/primefaces-extensions/primefaces-extensions.github.com/wiki/Release-Notes) list releases for all artefacts under the hood of PrimeFaces Extensions. This is a good place to see news and changes.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n[Internationalisation page](https://github.com/primefaces-extensions/primefaces-extensions.github.com/wiki/PrimeFaces-Extensions-Locales) describes PrimeFaces Extensions locales and corresponding translated text for multi-language support of some existing components. Please read instructions how to add a support for more locales.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nLast but not least is the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/primefaces-extensions/primefaces-extensions.github.com/issues?sort=created&state=open). Please feel free to create issues and feature requests there. Feel also free to initiate [Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). We will review and accept all reasonable suggestions and patches. This is a true open source project!\r\n\r\n## Additional Project Resources\r\n\r\nConvenient plugins and add-ons using for web application development are parts of this project.\r\n * [Getting Started with Resources Optimizer](https://github.com/primefaces-extensions/primefaces-extensions.github.com/wiki/Maven-plugin-for-web-resource-optimization) describes how to use our Maven plugin for resource optimization. This Maven plugin can be used to compress and merge JavaScript / CSS files and optimize loading of images by using of data URIs. The current released version is **0.6**.","google":"","tagline":"Additional JSF 2 components for PrimeFaces","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
